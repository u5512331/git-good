# Git Good

This repository contains a simple Fibonacci sequence program that I created as part of [UWCS's Git Good workshop](https://uwcs.co.uk/resources/git-good-2022/).

## Dependencies

A Java compiler and runtime, JDK 11 or newer.

## Compilation

Compile all the Java files with `javac *.java`.

## Usage

Run `java Fibonacci n` to generate the first `n` Fibonacci numbers and print them to standard output, starting from 0.
